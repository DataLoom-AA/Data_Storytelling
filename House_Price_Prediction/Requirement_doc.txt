Research Methodology
Methodology Overview:
1. Data Collection: The first step involves collecting historical data on various factors that 
influence house prices, such as property features (e.g., size, location, and amenities), 
economic indicators (e.g., interest rates, GDP growth), demographic data, and housing 
market trends. Sources of data may include public databases, real estate listings, 
government reports, and economic indicators.
2. Data Pre-processing: Once the data is collected, it undergoes pre-processing to ensure its 
quality and suitability for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing 
outliers, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables. Additionally, 
feature engineering techniques may be applied to create new variables or transform existing 
ones to better capture relationships with house prices.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is conducted to gain insights into the relationships 
between the independent variables (features) and the target variable (house prices). 
Visualization techniques such as scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices are used 
to identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers in the data.(bivariate and univariate analysis of each features)
4. Model Selection: Several predictive modelling techniques are evaluated to determine the 
most suitable approach for house price prediction. This may include linear regression, 
decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks, and other machine 
learning algorithms. The selection criteria typically consider predictive performance, 
interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability.
5. Model Training: The selected models are trained using a portion of the dataset, with the 
remainder held out for validation and testing. Techniques such as cross-validation may be 
employed to assess model performance and prevent overfitting. Hyper parameter tuning 
may also be performed to optimize model parameters and improve predictive accuracy.
6. Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated using appropriate performance 
metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean 
Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2). These metrics quantify the model's ability 
to accurately predict house prices on unseen data.

7. Model Interpretation: Interpretability techniques are applied to understand the factors 
driving house price predictions. Feature importance analysis, partial dependence plots 
values are commonly used to interpret the contribution of each feature to the model's 
predictions.
